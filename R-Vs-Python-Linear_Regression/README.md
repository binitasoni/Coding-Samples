# R Vs Python - Linear Regression

Using R markdown to compare R and python for linear regression on a medium-sized dataset (~500Mb).
Loading data, cleaning data, plotting data, speed, and ease of use are all compared to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each.

The dataset used is the 'Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data' from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data).

For the correctly formatted document the html/pdf file should be used, as Github's interpretation of the R markdown file is a little erroneous. Alternatively the project is posted on RPubs [here](http://rpubs.com/moocarme/R-Vs-Python-Linear_Regression).
