# Neural Networks in Python

Since scikit-learn has no native neural networks I decided to make my own based on Andrew Ngs Coursera machine learning course.
The neural network has only one hidden layer, but the number of nodes in the layer is variable.

The neural network works well, and is tested on the digit recognizer dataset from Kaggle which is included here as a .mat file.
