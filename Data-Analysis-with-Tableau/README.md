#Has Vision Zero Worked in NYC?

## Where to find project
The tableau workbook can be found [here] (https://public.tableau.com/profile/matthew.moocarme#!/vizhome/MotorCollisionsWorkbork_7Apr16/Story1) on Tableau Public.
The embedded dashboard is also on my website, with a more detailed analysis in R, which can be found [here](https://moocarme.github.io/Vision-Zero/).

##Data source
The data used is from the NYPD motor vehicle collisions dataset available on NYC open data [here] (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95).

##Motivation and conclusion
The tableau worksheet exploring the effectiveness of Vision Zero via the number of injuries from vehicle collision in NYC. Overall it does Vision Zero does appear to be effective in reducing the number of traffic related injuries. 
However, trends are examined across the dataset that could suggest where the future efforts could be spent to increase effectiveness and reduce injuries. The number of injuries is seen to increase at certain times of the year, notably summer and fall, also during rush hour communting times. Moreover, there are certain intersections and roads that contain a large number of collisions. Efforts spent targeting these roads, and times would result in greatest impact.
