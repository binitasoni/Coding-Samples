# Data Analysis using R

This folder contains files written in R to analyse data from the EPA and NYC's 311 service to determine whether there is a correlation between the concentration of lead and the number of 'lead' complaints in NYC.

The R script goes includes all the technical details, whereas the html/R-markdown file is more for non-technical presentations.
