# Does the Concentration of Airborne Lead Affect the Number of Complaints due to Lead in NYC?

## Where to find project 
The project can be viewed on RPubs [here](http://rpubs.com/moocarme/Pb-R-Analysis), which is a published version of the html file included here.

## Hypothesis
My hypothesis is that when there are changes in the concentration of lead in the NYC air, there will also be correlated changes in the number of complaints due to lead in the NYC 311 complaints.

### About the datasets
The 311 data comes from the 311 service requests dataset from the NYC open data website that can be found
[here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9), and the data on air concentration of lead can be found at the air quality dataset can be found on the EPA website  [here](https://www3.epa.gov/airdata/ad_data_daily.html).

### Files
The R script included is designed for a more technically proficient audience, whereas the R-marrkdow and html files are designed to accessible for less techinically proficent audiences.
