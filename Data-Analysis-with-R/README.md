# Data Analysis using R

This folder contains files written in R to analyse data from the EPA and NYC's 311 service to determine whether there is a correlation between the concentration of lead and the number of 'lead' complaints in NYC.

The R script goes includes all the technical details, whereas the html/R-markdown file is more for non-technical presentations.

The 311 complaint data for this script can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9), and the data quality data can be found [here](https://www3.epa.gov/airdata/ad_data_daily.html)
